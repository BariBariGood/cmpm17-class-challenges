# Instructions
For this activity, you will be creating and applying selectors in order to style elements from this folder's index.html page. Here are your tasks:

## HTML:
1. Create a class called "html", which should be assigned to the list item with the content HTML
2. Create an id called "css", which should be assigned to the list item with the content CSS

## CSS:
3. Apply the color #e35300 to the html class you created in step 1
4. Apply the color #3400d0 to the css class you created in step 2
5. Without creating a class/id, apply the color #dcd21e to the list item containing the content "JavaScript"

For an extra (optional) challenge, try the following:
6. Set the font of each item within this web page to be Segoe UI (no google fonts imports needed)

NOTE: Whenever you make changes to your HTML/CSS page, press CRTL+S if you're on windows, and COMMAND+S if you're on a Mac. This is because VSCode may not automatically save any changes you make as you modify files.
