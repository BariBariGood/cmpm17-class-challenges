# Instructions
For this activity, you are tasked with linking the "mystyles" CSS file to the index.html page. 

NOTE: Whenever you make changes to your HTML/CSS page, press CRTL+S if you're on windows, and COMMAND+S if you're on a Mac. This is because VSCode may not automatically save any changes you make as you modify files.

## How do I know if I completed the activity?
If the h1 text "I should be blue!" is the color blue, when you run the "Go Live" button at the bottom-right of VSCode, you have completed the activity.  

If you do not see a "Go Live" button, you will need to install the Live Server extension.
