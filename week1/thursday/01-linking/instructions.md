# Instructions
For this activity, you are tasked with linking the "mystyles" CSS file to the index.html page. 

## How do I know if I completed the activity?
If the h1 text "I should be blue!" is the color blue, when you run the "Go Live" button at the bottom-right of VSCode, you have completed the activity.  

If you do not see a "Go Live" button, you will need to install the Live Server extension.
