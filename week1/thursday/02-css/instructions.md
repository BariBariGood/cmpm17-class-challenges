# Instructions
For this activity, you are tasked with applying CSS styles in order to customize the index.html page within this folder. The following styles should be applied within the
styles.css file:

## For h1 elements:
- Should have a font size of 20px
- Text color should be purple

## For li (list item) elements:
- Should be given a margin of 10px
- Text color should be set to #a868b6

NOTE: Whenever you make changes to your HTML/CSS page, press CRTL+S if you're on windows, and COMMAND+S if you're on a Mac. This is because VSCode may not automatically save any changes you make as you modify files.
